## Assessment of Northwind Trading Company

The aim of this project is to evaluate the health of the fictitious Northwind Trading Company on several fronts as a demonstration of my proficiency with SQL, object-oriented databases, and hypothesis testing. First, the effectiveness of discounts in encouraging larger quantity orders and higher total order prices. Additionally, customer contact types will be evaluated to determine if certain types of contacts place larger orders with the company, and thus to suggest that similar types of contacts should be sought within prospective customer companies. Reaching out to a customer and finalizing a sale is meaningless if Northwind is failing logistically to get the product to the customer. For this reason, the cost and speed of shipping will be analyzed to determine if improvements can be made to streamline its practice. Lastly, an evaluation of the sales numbers of a sample of employees will be used to make recommendations on changes to current training protocols in an effort increase productivity.

## Discounts

The initial task was to determine if discounts increase order quantity, and if so, at what level of discount is the effect observed. The OrderDetail table contained information regarding the specific products, their quantity, unit price, and discount for each order. The price charged for each product within an order was calculated by multiplying the quantity purchased by its unit price, and then multiplying by one minus the discount. The orders were then grouped by OrderId and the sum of all items within an order and the sum of the price charged for each item in an order were calculated. The data was then grouped by orders that did not receive a discount and orders that did receive a discount. The distributions of order quantities for both samples were not normal and had unequal variances, thus non-parametric statistical testing was used. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests all determined that non-discounted order quantities are significantly different from discounted order quantities. Directionality of the significance was determined with a one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, where it was found that discounted order quantities are significantly larger than non-discounted orders. The discounted orders were then grouped into five discount levels (1-5%, 6-10%, 11-15%, 16-20%, and 20-25%) and the same three statistical tests were used in pairwise comparisons of these discount levels. These tests determined that all levels of discounts significantly increase order quantity over non-discounted orders. Most importantly though, no discount level significantly increased order quantity over any other discount level. The 25% discount level did have the strongest effect (0.57) on order quantity, as calculated by Cohen’s d. This same statistical testing procedure was repeated to evaluate the effect of discounts on order total. Discounted orders were found to be significantly higher in price than non-discounted orders, and the 5% discount levels had the strongest effect (0.31, as calculated by Cohen’s d) on increasing order price.

Based on these results, it can be concluded that discounts significantly affect both the order quantity and order price. It was found that discounts effect order quantity (0.40) more than order price (0.17), when effect size was evaluated with Cohen’s d. All discount levels significantly increase order quantity from non-discounted orders, where 25% discounts result in the strongest effect on order quantity. All discounts except for 20% discounts significantly increase order price from non-discounted orders, where 5% discounts result in the strongest effect on order price. Based on this evaluation, it can be suggested that discounts of 25% be offered on orders if the directive of the discount is to encourage the customer to purchase more items, and to offer 5% discounts if the directive of the discount is to encourage the customer to spend more money on an order.

## Customer Contacts

The next task was to determine if different customer contact types within the corporate hierarchy spend more on orders than others. The aim of this analysis was to help Northwind Traders target specific contacts within prospective customer companies that statistically have higher purchase order totals. The data for this analysis was obtained by joining the Customer, Order, and OrderDetail tables to get the contact title associated with each order Id and its unit price, quantity, and discount to calculate order totals. There was a wide range of orders made by each contact title (7 orders made by Owner/Marketing Assistant to 160 orders made by Sales Representatives), thus the different contact titles were logically grouped by suspected corporate level into four groups of relatively equal sample sizes. Pairwise comparisons were made between the distribution of order totals for each contact type and it was found that there is no significant difference. While these findings suggest that no recommendation can be made in terms of customer contact types to target for sales, the results do suggest that simply establishing a customer contact, regardless of their title, is positive in terms of potential sales.

## Shipping

A thorough analysis of the Northwind Traders shipping department was conducted with the aim evaluating the performance and costs of the three companies (Speedy Express, United Package, and Federal Package) on contract. The data for this analysis was obtained by joining the Order and OrderDetail tables to get the order date, required date, shipped date, total quantity, shipping company, delivery region, and freight costs for each order. Pairwise comparisons between the distribution of shipping costs for the three companies was performed. The results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of shipping costs between the three companies. The shipping costs for each company was then evaluated by delivery region. Six groups of relatively equal sample size were created by combining the shipments to Northern Europe with Scandinavian shipments, Eastern European shipments with Southern European shipments, and Central American shipments with South American shipments. Pairwise comparisons were made between the regional shipping costs for each company. The United Package shipping company had the fewest difference in shipping costs between the regions. Shipments going to Western Europe had significantly higher costs than three of the five other regions for the Speedy Express shipping company. The Federal Shipper company had the greatest number of significant differences in cost between the delivery regions, with Western European and North American shipments having significantly higher costs than a majority of the other regions. Thus, if shipping costs are difficult to predict (and therefore budget appropriately) while using three companies, Northwind Traders should consider using United Package exclusively for shipping as their costs are the most uniform between the different regions and because their costs do not differ significantly from the other two companies. 

The three companies were then assessed in terms of order processing times by calculating the number of days between the order date and the shipping date for each order. Again, pairwise comparisons were performed between the three companies and the results indicated that Federal Shipper has significantly shorter processing times than the other two companies. Additionally, when the shipments were grouped into small, medium, and large orders based on total quantity, testing indicated that there was no significant difference in order processing times between the shipment sizes for United Package and Federal Shipping. Speedy Express, however, had significantly longer processing times for small shipments than it did for large shipments. Thus, if shipping speed is the primary concern of Northwind Traders, Federal Shipper should be named the primary shipping company as it has significantly shorter processing times from the other two companies and because there was no difference found in processing times between order sizes.

## Employee Sales Performance

Lastly, the sales performance of the nine employees in the sample were evaluated in an attempt to discover any traits of high-earning employees that could be incorporated into training protocols. The data for this analysis was obtained by joining the Employee, Order, and OrderDetail tables to get name and birthdate of the employee associated with each order. Again, the total quantity and total price was calculated for each order, and it was noted whether a discount was applied to the order. The distribution of order totals were compared pairwise for each employee and only two comparisons were found to be significantly different out of 35 possible comparisons, each with relatively small effect sizes (0.28 and 0.29). Additionally, when the employees were grouped into young, middle age, and relatively old based on their stated birthdate and the date of this project (4/5/19), there was no significant difference between order totals of each age group. These results suggest assumed sales experience does not affect employee sales performance. 

Finally, each employee’s order totals were compared between discounted and non-discounted orders to determine if discounts can be offered strategically to encourage increased customer spending. These tests found that three of the nine employees in the sample had significantly higher order totals on discounted orders than on non-discounted orders. Employee training protocols could be modified to educate employees of the effects of discounts found during this project and how they can be applied to increase customer spending.

## Conclusion

This project attempted to evaluate the overall health of Northwind Traders by examining several aspects of the company’s sales and logistics. Statistical testing determined that discounts increase both order quantity and order total. Additionally, a third of the sampled employees saw higher sales numbers on discounted orders than from their orders that were not discounted. Based on these findings, it is recommended to discount orders to encourage increased customer spend and to train employees on how to best apply discounts to increase order totals when finalizing a deal with a customer. 

The order totals were analyzed based on the customer contact associated with each order to determine if a particular type of contact should be targeted within current and prospective customer companies to drive up sales numbers. The sample dataset used for this project contained 12 different customer contact titles representing various positions within the corporate hierarchy. The number of orders placed by each title ranged from 7-160, thus the titles were logically grouped into four categories based on similar levels within the corporate hierarchy. No statistical difference was found in terms of order totals between the four groups of customer contacts, suggesting that any contact that can be made with prospective customers should be pursued, regardless of position within the company. However, more data should be collected to further evaluate the individual customer contact titles, instead of the grouped contact types as there does appear to be trends that failed to reach significance in this project.

A thorough analysis of the three shipping companies utilized by Northwind Trading was conducted to determine if there was a difference in cost and performance between them. Overall, there is no difference in shipping costs between the three companies. But, some differences were found when the shipping costs for each company were evaluated by geographical region. For orders handled by Speedy Express, shipping costs are significantly higher for orders going to Western Europe than for three of the other five regions. The United Package shipping company had the fewest differences in shipping costs between the regions (3, all involving the Northern Europe/Scandinavia group) and Federal Shipper had the highest number of differences in shipping costs between the regions (8, mostly involving Western Europe and North America). Federal Shipper has a significantly lower order processing time than the other two shipping companies, and this speed of processing is not affected by the quantity of the order. Thus, since all three shipping companies deliver to all six geographical regions, it would be reasonable to use one shipping company exclusively. If shipping costs vary wildly from one fiscal year to the next (making budgeting predictions challenging), it is recommended to select United Package as the exclusive shipper of Northwind Trading as its shipping costs vary the least between regions and there is no significant difference in overall shipping cost from the other two shipping companies. If all shipping companies will be utilized moving forward, it would be prudent to evaluate the shipping cost between each company per region to determine if there is a significant difference in cost per region and thus divide responsibilities between the companies.
